# Tailwind CSS Typography

**Still very much a work-in-progress, not ready for use.**

A plugin that provides a `rich-text` class you can use to add sensible typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML you don't control (like HTML rendered from Markdown, or pulled from a CMS).

```html
<div class="rich-text">
  {{ markdown }}
</div>
```
